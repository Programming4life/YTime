Stop trying to find where you left of watching a youtube video.

Ever closed a youtube tab by mistake while watching a long video, then having to reopen it and find the position you were at? This extension will save the last position of youtube videos for you so you can return to the last position you were watching without having to do anything yourself.

Very useful for watching long youtube documentaries.

This extension can be found in the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ytime/affcjhachfpbbbjkcfhekhddlnbnkeee

Firefox version coming soon.
